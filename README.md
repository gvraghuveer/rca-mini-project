# 🚕 Ride Cancellation Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Ride cancellations reduce customer satisfaction and cause operational losses for ride-hailing platforms like Ola and Uber.  
This project analyzes historical ride booking data to understand **when and why cancellations occur** and builds a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of cancellation for a new ride request.

Instead of using raw pickup and drop location encodings, the project leverages **route-based historical cancellation risk**, which provides a more meaningful and realistic representation of location behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze booking and cancellation patterns
- Identify peak booking hours
- Understand key factors influencing ride cancellations
- Build a predictive machine learning model
- Incorporate **route-level cancellation history**
- Translate predictions into **actionable business decisions**

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Ola & Uber Ride Booking Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Records**: ~103,000 rides
- **Target Variable**: `is_cancelled`
  - `0` → Not Cancelled
  - `1` → Cancelled

### Final Features Used
- Booking hour
- Ride distance
- Booking value
- Customer rating
- Driver rating
- Payment method
- **Route cancellation rate**

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant identifiers
- Converted date and time columns
- Extracted booking hour
- Handled missing values
- Created binary target variable `is_cancelled`

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Booking volume by hour
- Cancellation distribution
- Ride distance vs cancellation trends
- Visualizations saved to `outputs/plots/`

---

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

#### 🔹 Route Cancellation Rate
Instead of using raw pickup and drop location encodings, a **route-based feature** was created:

route_cancellation_rate =
(Number of cancelled rides on a route) /
(Total rides on that route)


This captures historical cancellation behavior for a given pickup–drop route and avoids misleading numerical encodings of locations.

---

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Models
Two supervised learning models were trained and compared:

| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier | ~90% |
| Logistic Regression | ~90% |

**Random Forest** was selected for final predictions due to its robustness and ability to model non-linear relationships.

---

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Overall accuracy ≈ **90%**
- High recall for cancelled rides (~96%)
- No data leakage
- Good generalization on unseen data

---

### 6️⃣ Feature Importance (Key Insights)

| Feature | Importance |
|-------|------------|
| Ride Distance | Highest |
| Payment Method | Very High |
| Booking Value | Moderate |
| Route Cancellation Rate | Contextual |
| Ratings & Time | Supporting |

**Insight**:  
Long-distance rides, certain payment methods, and historically risky routes are more likely to be cancelled.

## 🔮 Route-Based Prediction (New Ride)

The system predicts cancellation risk for a new booking using booking details and route history.

### Example Output:
🚦Route-based Prediction:\
Route : KIA → Silk Board\
Historical Route Risk : 0.28\
Prediction : Not Cancelled\
Probability : 0.003421\
Risk Level : Low Risk\
Suggested Action : Proceed normally


---

## 🚦 Business Interpretation

| Risk Level | Suggested Action |
|----------|-----------------|
| Low Risk | Proceed normally |
| Medium Risk | Assign experienced driver |
| High Risk | Offer incentives or avoid assignment |

A **business-rule layer** can optionally override ML predictions for extreme cases, reflecting real-world decision systems.
